        Huntington Hills is one of the best, and last, remaining wooded areas in the County.&nbsp; Its natural beauty, 
        seclusion and protection from encroachment, with easy access to the City of Rochester, make Huntington Hills a 
        very desirable place to live. Upon first visit, one is amazed at the dense woods, deep ravines and beautiful
        streams. The area is home to a diverse population of plants and animals. Among them are American chestnut 
        trees, cherry trees, pine trees, maple trees, oak trees, woodpeckers, nuthatches, wild turkeys, fox, deer and 
        many others. With the continued interest of Huntington Hillsâ€™ members, the natural beauty of the area
        will be preserved for each others enjoyment as well as for future members.
