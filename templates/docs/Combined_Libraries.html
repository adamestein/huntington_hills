    <h1 id="proposal_main">Proposal</h1>

    <h2 class="medium" id="background">Background</h2>

    <p>
        This is a critical time for the Town of Irondequoit. One of the challenges facing our town is the lack of
        adequate facilities for our libraries and community services, including those for senior citizens. There is
        no one facility where residents can gather for activities, meetings or classes. Even after great community
        input, the last two community center proposals stalled and never came up for a vote.
    </p>

    <p>
        We believe that the residents of Irondequoit must get past the differences that divide us and unify in
        support of a plan that improves services and facilities for <strong><em>all</em></strong> Irondequoit
        residents. In this spirit, a group of residents representing key constituencies and stakeholders came
        together to consider the need for improved town facilities, and we now present this proposal to the
        Irondequoit Town Board.
    </p>

    <h2 class="medium" id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

    <p>
        We believe that the Town government should address the needs of the libraries, community center and senior
        services with a comprehensive plan rather than separate plans. We believe that a Consolidated Community Center
        that includes a consolidated library and senior services as well as other community services and facilities in a
        common location is the best solution for the Town.
    </p>

    <h2 class="medium" id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Irondequoit has no single center that brings people together for many purposes. Integrating community
            services in one place can unify the town and enhance the sense of community.
        </li>

        <li>
            A Consolidated Community Center has the potential to produce a synergy that enhances each individual
            component, and the rich environment of co-mingling seniors, youth, cultural groups and others would
            enhance life in our town. It is an exciting prospect because the agencies involved in such a facility
            can work together to provide services never possible before.
        </li>

        <li>
            Done well, this approach is the most economical because it reduces construction costs and operating
            expenses by consolidation, increased energy efficiency, and elimination of duplicated space,
            staffing and services.
        </li>

        <li>
            Additionally, some community center functions can be self-supporting with fees and memberships.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="medium" id="other">Other Considerations</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center should be as centrally located as possible, connected to surrounding
            neighborhoods/parks and accessible to varied forms of transportation. The Town Hall campus seems to fit
            this profile, however, other sites should be considered and compared. We are not limiting this proposal
            to a specific location.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center should maximize the quality of life in the Irondequoit community while
            being fiscally responsible. Whether the town decides to own/rent, build/buy, or entertains private/public
            ownership, the goal is an intelligently designed, high quality facility.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center planning work should begin as soon as possible. Prompt action can
            take advantage of the availability of stimulus funds and creates maximum flexibility for potential
            locations.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center concept should explore all funding sources. This includes grants,
            development funds and private fundraising, in addition to tax revenues.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center will involve either new construction or renovating existing space, and
            green design should be considered if its affordability can be enhanced by special grants and incentives.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center core proposal includes a consolidated library, senior and youth
            services, general purpose rooms for meetings/classes and public/display space. Other functions should
            be considered, and not all of these additional components would have to be developed at the outset. Some
            could be added later.
        </li>

        <li>
            The Consolidated Community Center should allow for as much space as possible to be designed as multi-use,
            to enable maximum flexibility in the future.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        A Consolidated Community Center will unify Irondequoit and enhance our sense of community. It has the
        potential to catalyze the revitalization of Irondequoit. We urge Supervisor Heyman and the Town Board to
        begin work on this proposal immediately, and we encourage the community to get behind it.

    <h1 id="future">The Future of Irondequoit's Libraries</h1>

    <p>
        At the Irondequoit Public Library our focus has always been on improving library services. If one examines
        the facilities, hours, collections, equipment and services of our libraries and compares them with the other
        town libraries around the county it quickly becomes apparent there is a big gap. Despite the fact that we are
        the second-largest town in the county, many other town libraries far surpass what is offered in Irondequoit.
        That gap is growing. The county's former number one library has fallen behind, way behind.
    </p>

        <p>
            We need to be open more hours and have larger collections. We need much more space and equipment to
            deliver the services our customers demand and often travel to other towns to obtain. Almost 20% of all
            library use by Irondequoit residents is now done outside Irondequoit. This number grows every year. The
            results of numerous studies indicate that we cannot deliver the required services with the buildings we
            have with or without cosmetic upgrades. These studies also showed that adding a few thousand square feet
            to the current buldings is inadequate, and the current facilities could not be expanded sufficiently to
            meet our space requirement. We need major upgrades in space and amenities to solve our problems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cost, especially these days, is a key factor for us, but there is more to the cost question than the
            price tag on renovated structures or new structures. The annual cost of operating the library is also
            important. Duplicating two full-service branches less than 3 miles apart is inherently inefficient.
            Believe me, officials in other towns laugh at the idea. Any responsible elected official would
            have to think long and hard about saddling the town with such an inefficient system long into the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            We know that some residents will want to keep the two library structure that we have in Irondequoit.
            This is understandable because we have lived with and used this system, and change is difficult. But
            to stay with our current libraries we will have to agree that Irondequiot residents do not need, want
            or deserve the same materials and services that are available in other towns. I do not accept this
            conclusion and I do not think the residents of Irondequoit will accept it either.
        </p>

        <p>
            A proposal has been made to the town to develop a centrally located community center with a consolidated
            library. This concept offers us a great opportunity to have the type of library facilities that the
            town needs but with smaller requirements for space than have been recommended for a freestanding library.
            This is because the community center and the library could share some facilities. Operating costs should
            also be reduced. But most important, combining the library with a community center will bring many more
            residents to the library to take advantage of our services. This will be a winning combination for
            Irondequoit.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our goal here has never been just to get a new building. Our goal is to cost effectively improve and
            expand library services so Irondequoit residents don't have to leave town to experience an excellent modern
            public library. Right now, unfortunately, that is what they must do. We understand the benefits that can
            result from being in the same location as a community center and the synergy that can result. The
            agencies involved in such a design can work together to provide services never before possible. This is a
            very exciting prospect. We support that vision.
        </p>
